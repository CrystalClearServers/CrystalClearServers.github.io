# Roleplay Information

Most of the rules are mentioned on this page. However, mistakes can still occur.

Therefore, staff may enforce rules to fill up the loopholes that come up.

If a player is found abusing these loopholes, warnings will be given followed up by a punishment if required.

## Infraction Consequences

The following actions may be taken in this order [unless violating a more serious offense]:

∘ Players shall be verbally warned or warned through our warning system about the rule they have broken.

∘ After a 2nd infraction, players may be jailed to go over the MOTD and receive a warn in the warning system.

∘ Players will be kicked after a 3rd warn is inputed into the warning system.

∘ A ban will be issued for a term of 2-4 days (depending on what occured) after recieving a 5th warn in the warning system.

∘ 3 Warns = Kick / 5 Warns = 2-4 day ban (depending on what occured). Warns will become inactive after 24 hours.

∘ For more serious offsenses a permanent ban may be issued and shall not be removed.
