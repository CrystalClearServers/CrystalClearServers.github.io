# Roleplay Information

Most of the rules are mentioned on this page. However, mistakes can still occur.

Therefore, staff may enforce rules to fill up the loopholes that come up.

If a player is found abusing these loopholes, warnings will be given followed up by a punishment if required.

No, this isn't for staff to be abusive, not every rule can be thought of, and not every little thing will be in this MOTD.

Because of this, please make suggestions if you feel we have missed something significant in our rules or have made an error.

## Infraction Consequences

The following actions may be taken in this order [unless violating a more serious offense]:

∘ Players shall be verbally warned or warned through our warning system about the rule they have broken.

∘ After a 2nd infraction, players may be jailed to go over the MOTD and receive a warn in the warning system.

∘ Players will be kicked after a 3rd warn is inputed into the warning system.

∘ A ban will be issued for a term of 2-4 days (depending on what occured) after recieving a 5th warn in the warning system.

∘ 3 Warns = Kick / 5 Warns = 2-4 day ban (depending on what occured). Warns will become inactive after 24 hours.

∘ For more serious offsenses a permanent ban may be issued and shall not be removed.
