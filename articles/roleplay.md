## Random Death-Match (RDM):

Do not randomly kill someone. (RDM - Random Death Match)

### However you **MAY** kill someone under these circumstances: 

- They have dealt damage to you

- They have injured a squad member

- You are countering/assisting a raid

- They are raiding you

- They have adverted "Kill Me"

- They have crossed a KOS line or went against a KOS sign you have placed

## New Life Rule (NLR):


The New Life Rule states that once you die, you may not have any interaction with your previous life and you may not return to the area in which you died within 5 minutes.
If there is a raid, you may not return until the raid is over even once the 5 minutes are up. (NLR does not apply if you are being revived with defib)

If you are caught interacting with your previous life within 5 minutes of your death, expect to be punished by staff.

NLR does NOT apply to the mayor, SWAT and secret service if they die in a PD or bank raid, however it does apply for them in any other situation.

Sewer monsters are exempt from this rule as long as they are killed in the sewers.
